In this we are programming an assembler in python language for the mentioned ISA and assembly. Here we are taking input to the assembler in a text file containing assembly instructions and the assembler generate a binary output text file. Assembler is generating error notifications along with line number (on which error is encountered) as an output text file.
The programmed assembler is capable of handling all supported instructions, labels, variables and 
returns a syntax error for any illegal instruction. We are generating a "General Syntax Error" for all the error conditions that are mentioned in the question.
